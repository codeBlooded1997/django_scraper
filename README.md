<h1>Craigslist Clone</h1>
<p>Arian Aghnaei</p>
<p>Fall 2019</p>
<p>Python 3.7.3</p>

<h3>I developed this web application in django framework and for scraping data I used beautifulsoup and requests for  extracting data from craigslist website.</h3>
<p>source websites : </p>
<ol>
		<li>https://www.carigslist.com</li>
</ol>

<p>In this project I combined a django powerd web application with a scraping tool whic user enters the search query in the browser and the extracted data will be dsiplayed in the browser.</p>
<p>I wish theese can be useful fore some one in some way</p>

<h2>What I learned :</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Using the entered data by user and using it in the scraping proccess.</li>
  <li>Developing a re usable Scraping object and make it useable in any application.</li>
  <li>Django powered web application design for deplaying web scraping toools and make it able to do searching on the web without need to install or run any command.</li>	
</ul>
