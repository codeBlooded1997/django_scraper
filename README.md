<h3>I created this open source project from scratch to get more into Django framework</h3>

<p>In this open source project, I combined a django powerd web application with a webscraping software. The most challenging part of this project for me was getting data from user and actually using the input data in my web scraping software.</p><br />
<p>I used Heroku for deploying the app. plaese take visit and test this scraper app :    https://arnial.herokuapp.com/</p>
<hr />
<h2>What I learned :</h2>
<ul>
  <li>UGetting data from user as an iput and using in the scraping software.</li>
  <li>Developing a scraper tool using Object Oriented Pradigm so it's possibl to use the scraper in other codes as a package.</li>
  <li>Django powered web application design for deplaying web scraping toools and make it able to do searching on the web without need to install or run any command.</li>
  <li>Deploying the scraper app using Heroku hosting service.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm interesting to know what you are thinking about this open source project so don't hesitate to contact me.</p><br />
<p>Thanks, Arian</p>
